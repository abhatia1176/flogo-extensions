# flogo-extensions
Custom extensions for Project Flogo

How to use Custom Functions: 

For instance, to use array functions, there are two options:

1. Use the following github url - github.com/abhatia1176/flogo-extensions/function/array
2. Clone Repo and zip up the directory "array" under "flogo-extensions/function" and upload it to the extensions in Flogo.

Please note that this will add a new category called custom_array under extensions. This can be changed by updating the descriptor.json file for that category.

Follow same approach as above for other category of functions.
