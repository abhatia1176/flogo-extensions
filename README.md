# flogo-extensions
Custom extensions for Project Flogo

# How to install Custom Functions: 

1. To install array functions, there are two options:

   a. Use the following github url - github.com/abhatia1176/flogo-extensions/function/array
       OR
   b. Clone Repo and zip up the directory "array" under "flogo-extensions/function" and upload it to the extensions in Flogo.

   We will use github url for instructions.
   
2. Go to Extensions tab on TCI or TIBCO Flogo Enterprise and click Import. The screenshot below shows the use of github url. Once you click import, the function(s) will be imported as new extension. Please note that this will add a new category called custom_array under extensions. This can be changed by updating the descriptor.json file for that category.

3. Once the import is successful, click Done, as shown in the screenshot below.



Follow same approach as above for other category of functions.
